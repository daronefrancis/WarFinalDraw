# War - Final Draw

Welcome to War!

This game was produced in correspondance for General Assembly Toronto - Unit One Project.

I hope you enjoy!

## How to Play

The card game war is simple but fun!

To play, the deck is shuffled and card are evenly distributed between two players.

The object of the game is to collect the most "war pairs" before each player has no more cards left in their hand. 
Each new round, players flip their top card and there is a dual between the cards. The player with the higher card value wins the round.
The winning player adds both played cards to their pairs pile.

This is a simplifed version of war - if dueling cards have an equal value no points are awarded for that round (there are no four-card duals for a tied round).
